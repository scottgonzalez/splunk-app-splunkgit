Getting started
---------------

### Installing splunk

#### Generic instructions

- [Download Splunk for your platform](http://www.splunk.com/download?r=productOverview).
- Unpack/Install Splunk by running the downloaded files.
- Follow the instructions on screen
- When done continue to *Installing Splunkgit App* section

`<SPLUNK_ROOT>` will from now on refer to the direcotry where you've extracted splunk.

### Installing splunkgit

- Make sure splunk is not running
- Open Terminal app
- Goto `<SPLUNK_ROOT>`: `cd <SPLUNK_ROOT>`
- Goto app directory: `cd etc/apps`
- Download the app: `git clone git://github.com/splunk/splunk-app-splunkgit.git`  
  You can also download a released version from the [tags](./splunk-app-splunkgit/tags) page.

### Configuration

- Make sure splunk is not running
- Open Terminal app
- Goto `<SPLUNK_ROOT>/etc/apps/splunk-app-splunkgit`
- Edit local/splunkgit.conf with a text editor (`open -e local/splunkgit.conf`) and assign the following values:
    - `repo_addresses=` The addresses to the repos, use the read-only address. Ex: `git://github.com/splunk/splunk-app-splunkgit.git`. You can have one or multiple repositories, space separated
    - `user=` Splunk user login so our scripts can search in Splunk
    - `password=` Splunk password for the user

#### Configurating multiple repositories in semi real-time
- Edit local/splunkgit.conf and assign `repo_addresses=` with multiple repositories by separating the repositories with a space. Ex: `repo_address=git://github.com/splunk/splunk-app-splunkgit.git git://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-java.git git://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-python.git`

- Copy default/inputs.conf to the local directory
- Set the interval value of the fetch_git_repo_data.sh script to a low value. Ex: 20
The git repositores will now be updated each 20 seconds. The views in multiple repositories dashboard will be updated whenever there's more data.

### Changing repository

- Make sure splunk is not running
- Run the following command to wipe all app data from splunk:

        splunk clean eventdata -f -index splunkgit

- Change the splunkgit.conf file, as described in *Configuration* section, to point to the new repo.

### Starting and stopping Splunk

- Open Terminal
- Goto `<SPLUNK_ROOT>`: `cd <SPLUNK_ROOT>`
- Start splunk `bin/splunk start`
    - On you web browser goto `http://localhost:8000`
    - If asked enter your name and user name (default value is **admin:changeme**)
    - If you change the password, you also need the change the configuration file to match this.
- Stop splunk: `bin/splunk stop`
